    <p>I'm a  high school student it  the state of Utah. I want to go to school for architecture but I love art in general. I got into digital media as a high school sophmore. I started taking classes my junior and senior years of high school. My favorite types of digital media is Photography and photoshop. I love taking photographs and editing them really makes them come to life. I hope to be able to take up photography as a side job along with architecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
